# Deep Learning Notebook

## About

This repository presents an annotated version of the paper in the form of a line-by-line implementation. It reorders and deletes some sections from the original paper and adds comments throughout. Each document itself is a working notebook, and should be a completely usable implementation.

Inspired by [The Annotated Transformer](https://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/annotated-transformer/), I create this repository to record my attempts to implement the method in the paper. I try my best to implement the method as straightforwardly as possible to maximize clarity and ease of understanding. References are listed in each notebook. I strongly recommend you to read the original paper and the official implementation.

## Data
